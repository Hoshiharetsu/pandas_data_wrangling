# Data manipulation &amp; cleaning in Pandas

## Review

In case anyone needs it, there's a folder in this directory labeled `numpy_pandas_review`, with Coral's intro to NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas from DAT-119. (If this doesn't feel like a DAT-119 review to you, it may not be; we don't always get to it during a 14-week semester.)

Eric's module from DAT-129 is [available on his website](https://technologyrediscovery.net/python/mod-analytics.html).
